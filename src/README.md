# MCU firmware

Current prototypes are made of:
- Micro beans with a Microchip mcu, power regulator, RS-485 adapter, micro switch and a led, icsp headers and four screw connectors. Nine custom i/o ports and supply pins are available through a 0.1‚Äù header. Custom pcb printed with professional support. Changing two parts it is possible to switch from 3.3V i/o to 5V. Size and footprints of components are designed to be manually soldered with iron: it can be miniaturized upgrading to small factors.
- A wired master node, made of custom board adapted to a Microchip card from elektronika, a ethernet header, voltage regulator, voltage drivers for the line, and a two- line display. Custom pcb manually realized.
- A wifi master node, made with a Raspberry Zero W and a custom board (wired prototype board).
